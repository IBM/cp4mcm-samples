<!-- Not always needed, but a scope helps the user understand in a short sentance like below, why this repo exists -->
## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide sample files and code snippets for IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management, for example, configuration yaml files, script sample files, and so on. Users can directly download these files for installing or configuring IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management.

<!-- A more detailed Usage or detailed explaination of the repository here -->
## Usage

Basically, users are directed to this repo from the [IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/kc_welcome_cloud_pak.html).  

In the IBM Knowledge Center topics, if the sample yaml file or script file is very long, we will not directly paste the content in the Knowledge Center page. Instead, we will upload the sample files in this repo, and then add a link in the Knowledge Center topic. By clicking the link, users open the specific file url and can then download the file to local for direct use.
